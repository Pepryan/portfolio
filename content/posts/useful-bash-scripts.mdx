# Useful Bash Scripts for DevOps

Here are some useful Bash scripts that I frequently use in my daily DevOps tasks.

## 1. System Resource Monitor

This script monitors CPU, Memory, and Disk usage: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo System Resource Monitor
echo "CPU Usage:"
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | sed "s/.,[0−9.]∗[0−9.]∗% id./\1/" | awk '{print 100 - $1}'%
echo "Memory Usage:"
free | grep Mem | awk '{print $3/$2 100.0}'%
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{print $5}'
```

## 2. Backup Script

This script creates a backup of a specified directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup Script
SOURCE="/path/to/source"
DESTINATION="/path/to/backup"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")
BACKUP_FILE="$DESTINATION/backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

tar -czf $BACKUP_FILE $SOURCE
echo "Backup created at $BACKUP_FILE"
```

## 3. Log Cleanup

This script cleans up old log files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Log Cleanup Script
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;
echo "Old log files deleted."
```

## 4. User Management

This script adds a new user and sets a password:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# User Management Script
read -p "Enter username: " USERNAME
sudo adduser $USERNAME
echo "User $USERNAME added."
```

## 5. Network Status Check

This script checks the network status:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Network Status Check Script
ping -c 4 google.com
```

## Conclusion

These scripts can help automate various tasks in your DevOps workflow. Feel free to modify them according to your needs!
